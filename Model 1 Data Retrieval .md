**Data Retrieval**  

This study utilizes data sample, from the sequencing of Lactoccocus Lactis species sample. The  raw data sample was collected and is freely available in the online repository (https:// www.  ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/) with the bio project accession number (PRJNA1012351). The details of the  analyzed sample are listed in Table 1\. In addition, these data were collected for the discovery of  novel biosynthetic peptides for therapeutic drug-based research and development.
